            Remote Working Manifesto

        <p>
            <i>
                We are uncovering better ways to organize the way we work remotely.<br/>
                In our journey, we consider the following key assumptions.
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Freedom, Trust, Transparency, and Ownership</strong> are the foundations of remote working.
        <p/>
        <p>
            We value <strong>life-work balance</strong>, and remote working doesn't mean being always available: organize your work time for a more balanced life.
        </p>
        <p>
            We should never forget we are working with <strong>human beings</strong>. <strong>Building relationships</strong> is an essential part of our life and work, and technology can bring us closer: it's up to us to use it well.
        </p>
        <p>
            We value <strong>environmental sustainability</strong>, and we strongly believe in remote working as a long-term solution for stopping the overpopulation of urban areas and the decay of rural ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forcing people to commute wastes energy: <strong>reduce your daily carbon footprint</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forcing people to commute wastes time: live where you want, and <strong>spend your time with your loved ones</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Value is produced by <strong>achieving results</strong>, not by spending time at the office: reaching goals are more important than 9 to 5.
        </p>
        <p>
            We value <strong>asynchronous communication</strong>, achieved with the most convenient tools. It doesn't matter where or when your work happens: more <strong>flexible working hours</strong> will make the team happier and produce higher quality results.
