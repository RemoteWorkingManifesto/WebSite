                We are uncovering better ways to organize the way we work remotely.<br/>
                In our journey, we consider the following key assumptions.
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Ownership</strong>, <strong>freedom</strong>, <strong>trust</strong>, and <strong>transparency</strong> are the foundations of our remote working.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that <strong>people</strong> and their <strong>interactions</strong> are more important than processes and tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            We talk about the <strong>results</strong> of work, rather than the time spent.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Teamwork</strong>, <strong>pair programming</strong>, and <strong>human relations</strong> are essential, but we prefer <strong>asynchronous</strong> to synchronous communication.
        </p> 
        <p>
            We love <strong>automating</strong> and <strong>documenting</strong> repetitive tasks, rather than performing the same manual actions over and over again.
        </p>
        <p>
            We prefer <strong>flexible working hours</strong> over set working hours.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe it is fundamental to <strong>define the boundaries</strong> of space and time between work and personal life.
        </p>
        <p>
            We think it is not important <strong>where you work</strong>, but that your <strong>environment</strong> shapes the way your work.
